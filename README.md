## A simple, two player, card game simulation.
#########

The deck of cards contains 52 cards with 13 cards each in the 4 suits:
clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades. Each player begins with 26 cards and one of the players starts the game
by putting their first card on the table. Players take turns by putting the
top card from their hand, until the current card placed on the table matches
the suit of the previous card on the table. If a match happens, then game player says snap and game is over.
